Whitebox Geospatial Analysis Tools
=====================================

Whitebox GAT is an open-source geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing package 
(http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hydrogeo/Whitebox/). The Whitebox GAT project began in 2009 and was conceived as a replacement for the 
Terrain Analysis System (TAS). Whitebox GAT was intended to have a broader focus than its predecessor, positioning it as 
an open-source desktop GIS and remote sensing software package for general applications of geospatial analysis and data 
visualization. Whitebox GAT is intended to provide a platform for advanced geospatial data analysis with applications 
in both environmental research and the geomatics industry more broadly. It was envisioned from the outset as providing an ideal 
platform for experimenting with novel geospatial analysis methods. Equally important is the projectâ€™s goal of providing a tool 
that can be used for geomatics-based education.
